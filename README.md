## How we built it

We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Gemini API

## Challenges we ran into

We had trouble figuring out how to use the Gemini API, we had outputs that did not work as intended or used up too many credits. We were able to optimize the credits taken from these features in PDF viewer and able to make each generation of studying tools unique.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

One of our teammates is a first time hacker and this is one of his first projects he has made. It was cool to be apart of a team that made a service that helps yourself and learning to build.

## What we learned

We learned how to use the Gemini API and how cool vibe coding can be

## What's next for PDFTutor

We know of a few launched businesses that do things similar to our product, but none quite like it. We think there is a space in the market for a product like this, and we are open to continuing to work on it.
